		<h2>Welcome to The Golden Lion Hotel!</h2>
		<p>Located just 200 metres from the beach, The Golden Lion Hotel is set in a Grade II listed building that stands on Cliff Parade
			overlooking the Green.</p>
		<p>The hotel was the first building ever constructed in Hunstanton, commissioned by Henry Le Strange and built in 1846, it was
			the only building to stand within a three mile stretch between the Lighthouse and Heacham for almost 16 years. It was originally
			named The New Inn, but for a while was known to those in society as 'Le Strange's Folly',
		</p>
		<p>
		 In 1862 the railway finally came to the town and was the trigger for Hunstanton to grow into the sea-side resort Le Strange had
			envisioned. Sadly in that same year Henry Le Strange died aged 47 without seeing his vision fulfilled.
		</p>
		<p>Hunstanton quickly expanded beyond the original coastal village and became a fully fledged Victorian seaside resort. </p>
